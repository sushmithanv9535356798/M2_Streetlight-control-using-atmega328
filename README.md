Project Title: Street light Control Using Atmega328
Smart Street light is an automated system which automates the street. The main aim of Smart Street
light is to reduce the power consumption when there are no vehicle movements on the road. The
Smart street light will glow with high intensity when there are vehicles on the road otherwise the
lights will remain off.
The Smart street light provides a solution for energy saving which is achieved by sensing an
approaching vehicle using the Ultrasonic sensors and then switching ON a block of street lights ahead
of the vehicle with high intensity. As the vehicle passes by, the trailing lights turn dim automatically.
Thus, we save a lot of energy. So, when there are no vehicles on the highway, then all the lights will
remain off. It is implemented using Microcontroller.
